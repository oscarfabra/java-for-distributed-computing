TITLE: Solution for Final Project
COURSE: CSCIE-55, "Java for Distributed Computing", Fall 2013
AUTHOR: Oscar Fabra, oscarfabra@gmail.com
LAST UPDATE: January 27, 2014

ASSUMPTIONS:

 * Security manager policy files are assigned under BankServer, ATMServer and 
   Client's main methods respectively, so there's no need to specify them on 
   execution time.
 * Additional assumptions made during the programming assignment were Javadoc-
   documented in their respective Java source files.

HOW TO EXECUTE MAIN PROCESSES:

Be sure to compile all sources and then execute each of the processes on a 
different command prompt.
# java -classpath cscie55.project.BankServer
# java -classpath cscie55.project.ATMServer
# java -classpath cscie55.project.Client
