COURSE: CSCIE E-55, "Java for Distributed Computing", Fall 2013

ASSUMPTIONS:

 * Solution was developed following step by step the spec given at the course 
   website.
 * All assumptions made during the programming assignment were Javadoc-
   documented in their respective Java source files. Please see each of the 
   Java source files listed above.

HOW TO USE ANT:

The default target compiles all the sources, puts the resulting .class files in
a different directory and builds the jar file from these files.
# ant -buildfile hw4-build.xml

To run all the created jUnit test cases, first be sure to execute the Server,
then run the tests on a different command prompt.
# ant -buildfile hw4-build.xml run-server
# ant -buildfile hw4-build.xml run-tests

To clean the generated class files.
# ant -buildfile hw4.build.xml clean

HOW TO EXECUTE MAIN PROCESSES:

Be sure to execute the Server and then the Client on a different command
prompt.
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.Server 7777
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.Client localhost 7777

HOW TO EXECUTE TESTS:

AccountTest and ATMImplementationTest can be run without any prior action.
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.tests.AccountTest
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.tests.ATMImplementationTest

But be sure to execute the Server and then the ATMProxyTest on a different
command prompt.
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.Server 7777
# java -classpath hw4.jar cscie55.hw4.ATMProxyTest localhost 7777
